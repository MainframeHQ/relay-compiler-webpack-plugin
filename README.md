# Relay Compiler Webpack Plugin

Are you running Relay Modern? Are you annoyed with constantly running the `relay-compiler` to generate code, especially if you're already running Webpack?

Well be annoyed no more! Simply install this plugin to automatically hook into Webpack's build process to generate these files for you.

## Installation

  1. Add this to your project:

```sh
  yarn add --dev relay-compiler-webpack-plugin
  # Or if you're using npm
  npm install --save-dev relay-compiler-webpack-plugin
```

  2. Add the plugin to your Webpack configuration:
  
```javascript
const RelayCompilerWebpackPlugin = require('relay-compiler-webpack-plugin')
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  // ... Your existing Webpack configuration
  plugins: [
    // ...
    new RelayCompilerWebpackPlugin({
      schema: path.resolve(__dirname, './relative/path/to/schema.graphql'), // or schema.json
      src: path.resolve(__dirname, './relative/path/to/source/files'),
    })
  ]
  // ...
}
```

  3. :tada:
  
### TODOs

Currently, the `relay-compiler` is undergoing a lot of work.
Various modules required by this library aren't modular enough to truly inject the generated files into Webpack's file hierarchy.
We'll be working with the `relay-compiler` to make it more modular in this regard as well as updating this project accordingly.

However it is still better than manually running the `relay-compiler` whenever anything changes.
Currently Webpack may build a few times once it picks up the files generated by this plugin.
